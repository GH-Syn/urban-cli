This contains everything that makes this program work.
You're probably thinking:

*"Why do you have hundreds of lines of code?"*

*"Why don't you split it up into different files?"*

And those are all great questions!

To answer both simultaneously, splitting this program up into different files is something that is generally considered good practice.
With that said, there are certain situations that may prevent you from doing this. This program is one of those situations.

As you'll likely recall in ``installation.sh``, only one file is added to path. If there are multiple files, everything gets really bizarre
and difficult to handle with relative imports. While it's *technically* possible, it's not worth the effort when code could work fine with just one file.

The most convenient part of all of this is configuring the documentation. The scale of the main file, despite how large, can be automatically documented as such.
It's for this reason I don't feel the need to split this documentation into sections, nor do I feel the need to make additional ``rst`` documentation.
