A core feature of this project (as it pertains to CI) is continuous testing and integration through unit tests and integration tests.
This practice heavily reduces bugs and unexpected happenstances that would otherwise occur if tests had not been written.
This program uses codecov as it's primary third party coverage tool.


## Metrics

Here's a grid view report given by codecov as a metric graph that gives a holistic view of each unit that's been tested.
Each block represents a single file in the project. The size and color of each block is represented by the number of statements and the coverage, respectively.

Here, the innermost circle is the entire project, moving away from the center are folders then, finally, a single file. The size and color of each slice is representing the number of statements and the coverage, respectively.

In this graph, the top section represents the entire project. Proceeding with folders and finally individual files. The size and color of each slice is representing the number of statements and the coverage, respectively.
