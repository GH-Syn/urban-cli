# About Urban CLI

Urban CLI was developed as a small portfolio side project while I was working at university.
It was developed over a period of a week, in which I spent developing and refining this project to be as optimized and bug-free as possible.

## Releases

Releases are tabulated. Tables are sorted in descending order.
