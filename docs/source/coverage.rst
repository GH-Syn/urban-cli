Coverage
=============

A core feature of this project (as it pertains to CI) is continuous testing and integration through unit tests and integration tests.
This practice heavily reduces bugs and unexpected happenstances that would otherwise occur if tests had not been written.
This program uses codecov as it's primary third party coverage tool. Coverage reports are generated in pull requests as well as on pushes
to the `main` branch to help indicate code utility and effectiveness.


Metrics

    Here's a grid view report given by `codecov`_ as a metric graph that gives a holistic view of each unit that's been tested.
    Each block represents a single file in the project. The size and color of each block is represented by the number of statements and the coverage, respectively.
