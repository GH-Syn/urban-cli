## Installation

On Linux platforms, run `sh install.sh`.
> This assumes that ~/.local/bin is present

For Windows, you'll have to manually modify your path
environment variables to add `%USERPROFILE%/Downloads/urban-tui/src/urban.py`
From there you'll have to type `urban.py` instead of `urban` (unless you install WSL through which you can run `install.sh`).

## Usage

Usage is as simple as typing `urban` followed by the word you'd like to see the definition for.
For example, to search the Urban Dictionary definition of the word "eshay" you'd type `urban eshay`.

Simple as that! :rocket:
