It is responsible for the following functions.

Data Manipulation
-----------------
When a request object is received, it needs to be formatted in a way that Python can understand
The beautifulsoup library helps beautifully âœ¨ with this. It parses html data in a way that can be 
read and manipulated very easily.

I/O handling
------------
The argparse library can be thought of as boilerplate level code in addition to a few extra classes 
that greatly help building a command line interface. It removes most of the argument logic and lets the
developer focus on what's important. Argparse is used in this file for showing and receiving data.

Common Data Structures
-----------------------
Common data structures such as a date, definition struct, lives in this file.
